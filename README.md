# image classification with modelNet and node js

Integrating machine learning/deep learning with client side makes it complete so the users can see the actual thing happening with the model trained. 

As usually the model is trained in python so showing it in browser with the use of **FLASK**(a minimal web framework of python) is easy. Doing it with node js as server is a real deal.
But it has also been made easy with the emergence of **TENSORFLOWJS**. Here is an image classification mobileNet model. First I wanted to see the predictions on terminal before showing it in the browser. This is the how it's done -
